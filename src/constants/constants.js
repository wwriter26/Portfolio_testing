    title: 'IT Intern | Lavner Education',
    description: "During the summer of 2023, I had the rewarding opportunity to contribute to the growth and development of the next wave of engineers and coders in my role as an IT Intern at Lavner Education. This experience encompassed a broad spectrum of technology-focused learning environments, including courses in Java and C++, as well as sessions devoted to the intriguing world of robotics.                      While this intensive, hands-on experience deepened my technical knowledge and enhanced my practical skill set, the real growth occurred in my ability to effectively communicate complex information. The challenge of explaining intricate coding concepts to young, eager minds demanded that I develop innovative, accessible, and comprehensible teaching methods. The techniques I honed during this period enabled me to break down advanced concepts into understandable segments. Consequently, this internship was not just an exercise in expanding my technical proficiency, but a journey into understanding the art of teaching. The skills I acquired in the process have not only enriched my expertise but have also elevated my capacity to inspire future tech enthusiasts.",
