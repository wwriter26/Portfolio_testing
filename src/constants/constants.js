    title: 'IT Intern | Redwood Trust',
    description: "During the summer of 2024, I had an incredibly rewarding experience as an IT Intern at Redwood Trust. This role was a deep dive into the heart of modern IT practices and allowed me to make meaningful contributions to both our infrastructure and development teams. One of my key responsibilities was researching the latest standards and best practices to ensure our operations were top-notch. One of my proudest achievements was automating semantic versioning and conventional commit practices. This was not just about writing scripts; it was about making our codebase more consistent and our team more organized. Seeing the positive impact of this automation on our workflow was incredibly satisfying. I also got hands-on experience with various aspects of IT infrastructure, from administrative functions to data center management, networking, cloud services, and virtualization. This broad exposure gave me a solid understanding of how all these pieces fit together to support the business. Another highlight was helping to implement a new branching strategy, CI/CD processes, and testing protocols using GitHub Actions. We moved from a complicated, outdated branching system to a streamlined single-branch GitHub Flow strategy. This change led to a 90% increase in production-ready code efficiency, which was a huge win for our team. This internship was not just about technical skills; it was about understanding the bigger picture of IT operations and development. I learned so much about how to drive efficiency and innovation in a corporate setting. This experience has not only sharpened my technical abilities but also given me valuable insights into the strategic side of IT.",

    title: 'IT Intern | Lavner Education',
    description: "During the summer of 2023, I had the rewarding opportunity to contribute to the growth and development of the next wave of engineers and coders in my role as an IT Intern at Lavner Education. This experience encompassed a broad spectrum of technology-focused learning environments, including courses in Java and C++, as well as sessions devoted to the intriguing world of robotics.                      While this intensive, hands-on experience deepened my technical knowledge and enhanced my practical skill set, the real growth occurred in my ability to effectively communicate complex information. The challenge of explaining intricate coding concepts to young, eager minds demanded that I develop innovative, accessible, and comprehensible teaching methods. The techniques I honed during this period enabled me to break down advanced concepts into understandable segments. Consequently, this internship was not just an exercise in expanding my technical proficiency, but a journey into understanding the art of teaching. The skills I acquired in the process have not only enriched my expertise but have also elevated my capacity to inspire future tech enthusiasts.",
